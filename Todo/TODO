1.) Build a user base - alternative option to Oauth (Can Oauth be used to create a user?)
2.) Make the Retweet functionality - repost the tweet on your account
3.) Make the Share functionality - Generate a link to the tweet
4.) Improve the tweet page - ability to like, delete and share comments
5.) Make a direct Messaging functionality
6.) Ability to bookmark a tweet - profile specific
7.) Profile Page - shows retweets, liked tweets and posted tweets and comments
8.) Build an explore page (maybe using twitter API for trends and hashtags)
9.) Hashtag functionality? - able to categorise tweets based on hashtags, can be found with search bar
10.) Popularity of hashtags - maybe end up with own trending system

Firebase for messaging - look into postgress / prisma ------- there is no magic with sql databases, need to make use of socket listener, or interval updates

Maybe make a 2048 clone game?
